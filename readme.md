# WhatsApp Integration Platform Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture of a WhatsApp Integration Platform designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. The architecture is structured in two primary stages: a monolith responsible for core functionality and a set of worker processes handling resource-intensive tasks.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this architecture are to:

*   Provide a scalable solution for managing multiple WhatsApp sessions.
*   Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
*   Optimize resource utilization.
*   Maintain a clear separation of concerns for easier development and maintenance.

## 3. Architecture Overview

The platform is divided into two main components:

1.  **Monolith:** Handles core API requests, session management, and task orchestration.
2.  **Worker Processes:** Offload resource-intensive tasks such as broadcasting, data scraping, and media processing.

## 4. Component Details

### 4.1 Monolith

The monolith is responsible for the core functionality of the platform.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Handles incoming API requests from clients.
    *   Manages WhatsApp session initialization and termination.
    *   Orchestrates cron jobs for data gathering.
    *   Enqueues resource-intensive tasks to a message queue.
    *   Manages session state and authentication.
    *   Provides API endpoints for clients to interact with the platform.
*   **Technology:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Key Modules:**
    *   API Handling: Manages incoming requests and responses.
    *   Session Management: Handles session creation, termination, and authentication.
    *   Task Orchestration: Enqueues tasks to the message queue.
    *   Monitoring: Tracks system health and performance.

### 4.2 Worker Processes

Worker processes are responsible for executing resource-intensive tasks.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Consume tasks from the message queue.
    *   Perform broadcasting, data scraping, and media processing.
    *   Operate independently and can be scaled based on demand.
    *   Require a valid WhatsApp session to be initialized before processing tasks.
*   **Technology:** Node.js with WhatsApp Web.js
*   **Key Modules:**
    *   Task Consumption: Retrieves tasks from the message queue.
    *   WhatsApp Interaction: Interacts with WhatsApp Web.js to perform actions.
    *   Data Processing: Handles data scraping, media processing, and other intensive tasks.

### 4.3 Message Queue

The message queue facilitates asynchronous communication between the monolith and worker processes.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Provides asynchronous communication between the Monolith and Worker Processes.
    *   Ensures task persistence and delivery guarantees.
    *   Enables load balancing across available workers.
*   **Technology:** RabbitMQ or Kafka

### 4.4 Authentication Data Storage

Authentication data storage securely stores the authentication data for each WhatsApp session.

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Securely stores the authentication data (session data) for each WhatsApp session.
    *   Provides fast access to the authentication data for worker processes.
*   **Technology:** Redis (recommended)

## 6. Scaling Strategy

### 6.1 Monolith Scaling

The monolith can be scaled vertically (increase CPU, memory) as needed. Optimize code for performance and caching.

### 6.2 Worker Scaling

Worker processes should be scaled according to these guidelines for optimal performance:

*   **Memory-based allocation**: 4-8 WhatsApp sessions per 4GB RAM (each session uses ~150-300MB)
*   **CPU-based allocation**: 4-8 sessions per 2 vCPUs
*   **Activity-based**: Fewer sessions for high-message-volume accounts
*   **Session type consideration**: Schedule more demanding broadcast sessions on dedicated workers

### 6.3 Dynamic Scaling Triggers

The system should automatically scale based on these metrics:

*   Message queue depth exceeding a threshold.
*   Average CPU utilization of worker processes exceeding 70%.
*   Memory utilization of worker processes exceeding 80%.

## 7. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Task Queue and Worker Extraction

1.  Implement a message broker for task distribution.
2.  Extract resource-intensive tasks to worker processes.
3.  Maintain session affinity within the monolith.

### Phase 2: Dynamic Worker Scaling

1.  Implement dynamic scaling for worker processes based on system metrics.
2.  Implement Redis for session sharing.
3.  Deploy monitoring and autoscaling infrastructure.

## 8. Authentication Data Management

*   Store WhatsApp session files in Redis with TTL
*   Implement secure retrieval by workers with session-specific keys
*   Implement versioning to detect outdated session data
*   Perform periodic backup to persistent storage

## 9. Security Considerations

*   All communication between components is encrypted.
*   Access to Redis is protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   The authentication data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   Regular security audits are conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## 10. Monitoring and Health Management

Implement comprehensive monitoring to tune your scaling strategy:

```javascript
// Collect worker metrics periodically
const workerMetrics = [
  'activeSessionCount',
  'memoryUsage',
  'cpuUtilization',
  'messageThroughput',
  'queueDepth',
  'responseLatency'
];
```

Use these metrics to:
1. Identify overloaded workers
2. Detect session performance issues
3. Optimize allocation strategy
4. Predict scaling needs

## 11. Conclusion

This two-stage architecture provides a scalable and maintainable solution for WhatsApp integration. By offloading resource-intensive tasks to worker processes, the monolith can focus on core functionality, improving overall system performance and reliability.
