# WhatsApp Integration Platform Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture for a WhatsApp Integration Platform, designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. The architecture centers on a monolith for core functions and containerized worker processes for resource-intensive tasks.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this architecture are to:

*   **Scalability:** Support a large number of concurrent WhatsApp sessions and message throughput.
*   **Reliability:** Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
*   **Security:** Protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Maintainability:** Maintain a clear separation of concerns for easier development and maintenance.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Efficiently utilize system resources (CPU, memory, network).
*   **Simplified Deployment:** Streamline deployment and management through containerization.

## 3. Architecture Overview

The platform comprises two main components:

1.  **Monolith:** Manages core API requests, session management, task orchestration, and load balancing.
2.  **Worker Containers:** Hosts multiple worker processes to offload resource-intensive tasks like broadcasting, data scraping, and media processing.

## 6. Scaling Strategy

### 6.1 Monolith Scaling

The monolith's scaling strategy focuses on optimizing resource utilization.

*   **Resource Optimization:**
    *   Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   Optimize code for database queries, API handling, and session management.
    *   Implement caching to reduce database load.
    *   Use connection pooling.
    *   Leverage asynchronous operations.
*   **Horizontal Scaling:**
    *   Deploy multiple monolith instances behind a load balancer.
    *   Use a session store to share session data.
    *   Implement health checks.

### 6.2 Worker Container Scaling

Worker containers are scaled for optimal performance.

*   **Memory-based allocation**: 4-8 WhatsApp sessions per 4GB RAM.
*   **CPU-based allocation**: 4-8 sessions per 2 vCPUs.
*   **Activity-based**: Fewer sessions for high-message-volume accounts.
*   **Container Density**: Optimize worker processes per container based on testing.

### 6.3 Dynamic Scaling Triggers

The system automatically scales worker containers based on:

*   Message queue depth.
*   Average CPU utilization.
*   Memory utilization.
*   Number of active WhatsApp sessions.

### 6.4 Scaling Implementation

*   **Container Orchestration (Recommended):**
    *   Use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage worker containers.
    *   Implement auto-scaling based on CPU and memory utilization.
    *   Use liveness and readiness probes.
*   **VM-based Scaling:**
    *   Use auto-scaling groups to automatically scale worker VMs.

## 10. Monitoring and Health Management

The system monitors key metrics:

```javascript
// Collect worker metrics periodically
const workerMetrics = [
  'activeSessionCount',
  'memoryUsage',
  'cpuUtilization',
  'messageThroughput',
  'queueDepth',
  'responseLatency'
];
```

These metrics are used to:

1.  Identify overloaded workers.
2.  Detect session performance issues.
3.  Optimize allocation strategy.
4.  Predict scaling needs.
5.  Implement automated alerts.

## 11. Potential Questions and Answers

*   **Q: Why use a Master-Worker architecture?**
    *   A: This pattern allows central session management while distributing resource-intensive tasks.
*   **Q: How is session affinity ensured?**
    *   A: The Monolith maps sessions to worker containers using consistent hashing.
*   **Q: How are worker failures handled?**
    *   A: The container orchestration platform monitors worker health and restarts them if needed. The Message Queue provides task persistence.
*   **Q: How is authentication data secured?**
    *   A: Authentication data is stored securely in Redis/GCS, protected by encryption and access controls.
